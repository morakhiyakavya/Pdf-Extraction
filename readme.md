Here we are trying to convert a pdf into a excel

In pdf_extractor.py we are using to extract the chapter in form of sections and sub-sections

In pandas_table.py we are getting all the question from the chapter and then we are converting it into a excel file. also we can uncomment few lines to get answers also.
